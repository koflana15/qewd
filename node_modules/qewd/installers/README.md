# QEWD Installers: Pre-built automated installers for creating working EWD 3 systems
 
This folder contains installers for creating ready-to-run QEWD systems.  They are ideal for anyone
new to QEWD and Redis, Cache or GT.M who wants to quickly discover how it works etc.  They are also a great way to quickly get a
working QEWD system up and running that you can then adapt and customise.

The installers are for use with Linux systems, virtual machines or Amazon EC2 instances, and also for the Raspberry Pi.

Use them as a starting point and guide for creating customised systems and/or for installing QEWD on systems that already 
include Node.js, Cache or GT.M

## Using the Installers

### Installing QEWD with the YottaDB Database

On a freshly-installed Ubuntu system or on  a Raspberry Pi with Raspian freshly installed:

     cd ~
     wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robtweed/qewd/master/installers/install_yottadb.sh
     source install_yottadb.sh

Note: this will install and configure:

- Node.js
- YottaDB
- QEWD
- NodeM

On completion, QEWD will be ready for use - just start it up.

Don't use this installer if you already have some or all of the components already installed.


### Installing QEWD with the GlobalsDB Database

On a freshly-installed Ubuntu system:

     cd ~
     wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robtweed/qewd/master/installers/install_globalsdb.sh
     source install_globalsdb.sh

Note: this will install and configure:

- Node.js
- GlobalsDB
- QEWD
- cache.node

On completion, QEWD will be ready for use - just start it up.

Don't use this installer if you already have some or all of the components already installed.


### Installing QEWD with the Cache Database

The install script at:

     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robtweed/qewd/master/installers/install_cache.sh

 is not intended to be run as a script, but more as a template set of instructions that you should
 use as a baseline and adapt, as appropriate, for your particular system.


### Installing QEWD, Redis and ewd-redis-globals on a Raspberry Pi

See above for installing QEWD and YottaDB on your Raspberry Pi.

If you'd prefer to use Redis with QEWD on your Raspberry Pi:

  The installer assumes you've done a fresh installation of NOOBS/Raspbian.  Then:

     cd ~
     wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robtweed/qewd/master/installers/install_rpi.sh
     source install_rpi.sh

  Be patient - it all takes quite a while to install, but it should get there in the end. 



## Running QEWD


Start QEWD using

     cd ~/qewd
     node qewd

On a Cach&eacute; / Linux system you'll probably need to use sudo:

     cd ~/qewd
     sudo node qewd


## Running the qewd-monitor Application


QEWD will be listening on port 8080, so, to try out the qewd-monitor application, use the URL:

     http://192.168.1.230:8080/qewd-monitor/index.html

     (change the IP address to that assigned to your Linux machine or Raspberry Pi)

When prompted for a password, enter:

     keepThisSecret!

You can change the password by editing the startup file: ~/qewd/qewd.js
