Thanks to Ward De Backer for debugging assistance and functionality suggestions

## What is QEWD?

This is best answered by reading [this article on QEWD](https://robtweed.wordpress.com/2017/04/18/having-your-node-js-cake-and-eating-it-too/)

In summary: [QEWD](http://qewdjs.com) is a Node.js-based platform for developing and running interactive browser-based applications and Web/REST services.

QEWD makes use of the [ewd-qoper8](https://github.com/robtweed/ewd-qoper8) module to provide an isolated run-time 
environment for each of your message/request handler functions, meaning that your JavaScript handler functions can use synchronous, 
blocking APIs if you wish / prefer.

QEWD includes an embedded persistent JSON database and session store/cache using Global Storage provided by either the Redis, 
GT.M or Cache databases.

Interactive QEWD applications can be developed using any client-side JavaScript framework (eg Angular, React, etc).

A single instance of QEWD can simultaneously support multiple browser-based applications and Web/REST services.

QEWD uses Express to provide its outward-facing HTTP(S) interface, and Socket.io to provide its outward-facing Web-socket interface.


## Installing

You can install QEWD.js by typing:

       npm install qewd

However, you'll need to then set up the run-time environment manually.

Simpler options are:

- If you're starting from a "clean slate", you should take a look at the [pre-built installer scripts](https://github.com/robtweed/qewd/tree/master/installers)
for Linux and Raspberry Pi systems.

- If you've already installed Node.js, first create a directory to act as the "root" directory for
QEWD, eg:

        ~/qewdjs

Then do the following:

        cd ~/qewdjs   # or whatever your 'root' directory is
        wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robtweed/qewd/master/installers/package.json
        npm install

This will install QEWD using NPM as before, but then allows you to run a setup script:

        npm run setup


Answer the questions it ask you, and it will create a working run-time environment for you.

###Note: this setup script will NOT install one of the databases used by QEWD (eg GT.M, YottaDB, 
Cache or Redis).  You'll need to do this manually.  If you want to use Redis, QEWD expects a default
installation, listening on port 6379.

For further details on installing and configuring QEWD.js, see 
[this presentation slide deck](https://www.slideshare.net/robtweed/installing-configuring-ewdxpress).
